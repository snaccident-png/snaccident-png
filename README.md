- 👋 Hi, I’m @snaccident-png
- 👀 I’m interested in building on my programming skills which are relatively new (2023).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming desktop games in C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I created this Github account to try to get help with programming in C#.
- 📫 How to reach me ---- I guess here on GitHub? Email details can be provided upon request but suspected spam accounts will be ignored.
- 😄 Pronouns: He / his / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learnt how to program text-based games using C# during a vocational IT-related course in 2023. I graduated at the end of 2023
  and then in May or June 2024, I probably downloaded the old Snake game onto a Samsung smartphone and played it for a bit and then felt the urge to
  want to make my own Snake game. Fast forward to 11th December 2024, my Snake game called 'Nathan's Snake Game' is on version 2.

  (OLD) I recently went back to programming the Snake game for version 3, the final version of the game, but during my time programming I somehow broke the most
  necessary function and now I cannot play my game.

  (NEW) Update on 10th January 2025: I found a line of code for a button in one of the Designer class files which may have stopped the most necessary function (using the arrow keys on a keyboard to move the snake sprite) and substituted it with a label to do the same thing as the button but better. Nathan's Snake Game v3, the third and final version of my Snake game, was released for free on my Nathan Tries To Make Games website on 4th or 5th January. I may have attached the weblink to the website to my GitHub profile.

  I caused another issue for myself during development for a new C# game. For verbose detail, please find snaccident-png/Newgame_Jan-2025.
