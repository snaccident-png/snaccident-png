- 👋 Hi, I’m @snaccident-png
- 👀 I’m interested in building on my programming skills which are relatively new (2023).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming desktop games in C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I created this Github account to try to get help with programming in C#.
- 📫 How to reach me ---- I guess here on GitHub? Email details can be provided upon request but suspected spam accounts will be ignored.
- 😄 Pronouns: He / his / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learnt how to program text-based games using C# during a vocational IT-related course in 2023. I graduated at the end of 2023
  and then in May or June 2024, I probably downloaded the old Snake game onto a Samsung smartphone and played it for a bit and then felt the urge to
  want to make my own Snake game. Fast forward to 11th December 2024, my Snake game called 'Nathan's Snake Game' is on version 2. I recently went
  back to programming the Snake game for version 3, the final version of the game, but during my time programming I somehow broke the most
  necessary function and now I cannot play my game.
